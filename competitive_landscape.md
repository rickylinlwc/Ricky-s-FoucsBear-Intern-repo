# Competitive Landscape - Focus Bear vs Freedom, Cold Turkey, Tiimo, Routinery

- **Freedom** is primarily a **blocker-first** tool: blocklists, recurring schedules, and a "Locked Mode" that prevents ending an active session early, with cross-device syncing (and even ChromeOS support).  
- **Cold Turkey** is a **hardcore desktop blocker**: it markets itself as extremely difficult to bypass once locked, and includes strict enforcement options (e.g., stronger lock controls / system-level restrictions).  
- **Tiimo** is a **planner-first** app: visual scheduling, timers, and AI-assisted checklists/planning designed for ADHD/autism/executive function (more about planning your day than blocking distractions).  
- **Routinery** is a **routine execution** app: guiding you through routines with timers/structured steps and habit tracking (less about strict cross-device blocking).

In contrast:
## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
**Focus Bear feels more "all-in-one"  for AuDHD routines + focus**:
- It combines **cross-device distraction blocking** with **guided routines** (morning/evening) and **break guidance**, rather than being only a blocker or only a routine planner. It’s also explicitly built by/for **AuDHD (ADHD + ASD)** users.  
- It has features like **Meeting Mode** (a dedicated focus block for meetings) and break systems designed to reduce burnout.  
- On Android, it describes using **real-time detection** to block distracting sites/apps and mentions an **AI low-dopamine view** of content in some cases. 



## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
If I wanted **both** (1) strong distraction blocking **and** (2) a system that actively guides my routines and breaks, I'd choose Focus Bear because it bundles those together.  
I can imagine using it when I'm working/studying and keep falling into "quick distractions" (YouTube/social/news) and also when my routines collapse during busy weeks-because Focus Bear targets *both* the distraction moment and the habit/routine structure.

Freedom and Cold Turkey are strong if my only need is "block distractions reliably," but they don't seem as focused on *guided habit routines + breaks + meeting support* as a combined system. Tiimo and Routinery are great for planning/routines, but Focus Bear's advantage is tying routines directly to **blocking** so the routine is harder to derail.

## What's one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn't?
One standout is **Cold Turkey's extreme "hard to bypass" enforcement** on desktop (it emphasizes being very difficult to stop once locked). That level of strictness can be useful for people who need "no escape hatches."
Focus Bear, by comparison, mentions you can remove blocks in an emergency, which is more flexible but potentially easier to override in a weak-moment scenario.

## Based on your research, what's one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
A practical improvement would be to add **more granular "trictness levels" and anti-bypass controls** (similar to the idea of stronger lock modes), so users can choose between:
- gentle support (easy to adjust), and
- strict "no-excuses" focus blocks (harder to disable once started)

This would help Focus Bear serve users who currently prefer Cold Turkey-style enforcement, while still keeping Focus Bear;s routine/break system as its unique value.
