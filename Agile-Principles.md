## Reflection

### Biggest benefits and challenges of Agile
**Benefits**
- Faster feedback and learning (less time spent building the wrong thing)
- Easier to adapt when requirements change
- Progress is visible and measurable in small increments
- Encourages teamwork and continuous improvement

**Challenges**
- If priorities change too often, can feel chaotic
- Requires strong communication and clear definitions of “done”
- Without good task hygiene, boards can become messy (too many “in progress” tasks)
- Can be hard to estimate timelines if scope keeps evolving

### How Agile principles can help my role and responsibilities
- I can deliver work in small, reviewable pieces (docs, PRs, small fixes), which makes feedback quicker.
- I can communicate blockers early, so the team isn’t surprised late.
- I can stay flexible: adjust what I work on based on the team’s highest priority.
- I can improve quality by iterating: ship a first draft, get comments, refine.

## Task

### Main differences between Scrum and Kanban (my own words)
Scrum is like working in fixed rounds (sprints): plan the round, do the work, review, then improve.  
Kanban is like a continuous pipeline: keep tasks flowing from “not started” to “done,” limit how many are in progress, and fix bottlenecks as they appear. Scrum is more schedule/cadence-driven; Kanban is more flow/bottleneck-driven.

### One Agile principle that will be most useful in my work
**“Deliver value in small increments and get feedback early.”**  
As an intern, this helps me avoid spending too long on the wrong approach. I can share a draft/PR early, confirm I’m on the right track, and iterate quickly.
