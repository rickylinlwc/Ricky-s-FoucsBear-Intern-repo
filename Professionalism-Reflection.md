### 1) A time I experienced great teamwork/professionalism
I’ve seen great teamwork when everyone shared the same goal, communicated progress honestly, and treated each other with respect. It was effective because people followed through on tasks, asked questions early, and updated the group quickly when something was blocked—so problems didn’t stay hidden.

### 2) Steps I can take to keep communication clear, respectful, and inclusive
- Write messages with: **Context → What I tried → What I recommend → What I need**
- Avoid blaming language; use “I” statements and focus on facts.
- Choose inclusive language and avoid jokes that could make others uncomfortable.
- If I’m frustrated, I’ll wait a few minutes before replying and re-read my message.

### 3) How I can help create a positive, fun, and professional environment
- Be friendly and supportive, but still reliable and accountable.
- Celebrate small wins (e.g., “Nice catch”, “Thanks for the quick review”).
- Offer help when someone is blocked, and share useful resources/templates.
- Keep humour light and respectful.

### 4) How I will prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors/colleagues
Before the meeting I will:
- Write a 3-bullet agenda: **goal**, **questions**, **decision needed**
- Bring links (issue/PR/doc) and a short status update: **Done / Next / Blocked**
- If I need feedback, I’ll point to the exact section and ask a specific question.

### 5) What being proactive looks like during my internship
- Creating issues/checklists for tasks instead of waiting for direction.
- Raising risks early (privacy/security/blocked work), not at the deadline.
- Sending progress updates without being asked.
- Suggesting small improvements when I notice repeated friction.

### 6) Following up and escalation if I need info/action
My approach:
1. **Initial message** (clear request + deadline + context).
2. If no response after a reasonable time, send a **polite follow-up**: “Just bumping this—still needed for X.”
3. If it’s blocking work and still no response, I’ll **raise it in standup** or message the relevant channel.
4. If it’s urgent or high impact (security/privacy/customer impact), I’ll escalate faster via the most appropriate channel (including phone if required by the urgency rules).

### 7) Things I won’t do
- I won’t share confidential data in public channels or commit secrets to Git.
- I won’t use rude, discriminatory, or toxic language.
- I won’t pretend I finished something if I didn’t.
- I won’t make high-risk changes without asking/reviewing first.
- I won’t ignore feedback—I’ll respond and act on it.
