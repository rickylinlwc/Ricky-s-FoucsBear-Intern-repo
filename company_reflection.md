# **Company Reflection**

## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
Focus Bear was created to help people with ADHD/ASD stay focused, because the team felt that existing tools didn't work well for neurodivergent brains.

## What problem is Focus Bear solving?
Focus Bear helps solve the problem of people struggling to stay focused getting distracted by other apps or doing unnecessary things instead of what they should be doing at the time. It also supports healthier daily habits, such as morning workouts and consistent routines.

**Two features I explored on the Focus Bear website:**
- **Distraction blocking / Focus Mode:** The site explains how Focus Bear can block distracting apps and websites so you can stay on the task you intended to do. This stood out to me because it targets the exact moment when I get derailed (opening one app "for a second and losing 30 minutes).
- **Morning & Evening routines:** The website shows that Focus Bear supports step-by-step routines. I like that it treats routines as a system rather than a motivational slogan.

## Why do you think this mission is important?
Digital distractions are everywhere, and for many people especially those with ADHD/ASD they can disrupt study, work, and wellbeing. By blocking distractions and helping people build routines and recovery breaks, Focus Bear can make productivity more sustainable instead of exhausting.

## How does Focus Bear's work align with your personal values or interests?
It aligns with my interest in using technology to solve real human problems in a practical way. I also like that the product focuses on building systems and routines rather than relying on motivation alone.

## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Yes. Even without a diagnosis, I relate to how easily my phone can distract me from my work, how I procrastinate on tasks that matter, and how my routines can fall apart when my schedule gets busy. For example sometimes during study I get distracted by my friends instagram messages, using this app it can block those messages for me and help me stay focus.
