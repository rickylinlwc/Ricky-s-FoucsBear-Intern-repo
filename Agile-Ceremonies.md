## Reflection

### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Agile ceremonies create regular checkpoints so everyone stays aligned on priorities, progress, and blockers. They reduce confusion by making work visible and by encouraging short, frequent communication instead of waiting until a problem becomes big. For example:
- Stand-ups keep the team synced day-to-day and surface blockers early.
- Planning / prioritisation ensures people work on the most important tasks first.
- Retrospectives help the team improve how they work (not just what they build) by identifying what went well and what needs to change.
- Backlog refinement keeps tasks clear and ready so work can flow without repeated clarification.

### Which ceremony is most important for your role, and why?
For my role as an intern, the most important ceremony is the **daily stand-up (or async stand-up)**. It helps me:
- confirm I’m working on the right priority
- share what I finished and what I’m doing next
- raise blockers quickly (access, unclear requirements, review needed)
- get fast feedback so I don’t spend too long going in the wrong direction

## Task

### Stand-up observation
I attended a stand-up meeting and observed that updates are shared in a short, structured format, usually covering:
- what was done since the last update
- what will be done next
- any blockers or risks

### Retrospective participation / review
I participated in a retrospective (or reviewed past retrospective notes) and noticed the focus is on improving the process, not blaming individuals. Common topics included:
- what went well and should be repeated
- what slowed work down (blockers, unclear tasks, delayed reviews)
- one or two concrete actions to improve next week

### One change I can make to improve team collaboration
I will post clearer async updates using a consistent template and include links so teammates can verify or review quickly:

- **Done:** (what I completed) + link to PR/commit/doc  
- **Next:** (what I will do next)  
- **Blocked:** (what I’m waiting on and who/what can unblock it)  
- **Context:** (1 sentence if needed)
