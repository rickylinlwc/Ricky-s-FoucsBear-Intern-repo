# Cyber Security Guidelines

## What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
**What I currently do**
- Use a password manager and avoid reusing passwords.
- Enable MFA on important accounts (email, banking, etc.).
- Keep Windows and browsers updated.
- Be cautious with links/attachments and check the sender + URL.
## How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
- Reviews of account security settings and connected apps.
- Improve device security hygiene (backups, locking screen).
- Be more consistent with separating "work vs personal" accounts.
- Reduce permissions/extensions I don't need.

## What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
- Use unique long passwords (or passphrases) for every account via a password manager.
- Turn security into defaults: password manager autofill, MFA, auto-updates on.
- Security maintenance: routine (updates, review logins, backups).
- Review third-party app access (OAuth) and remove anything unused.

## What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
1. **Act fast:** change the password and sign out of all sessions/devices.
2. **Secure access:** turn on/strengthen MFA and update recovery options.
3. **Check evidence:** review recent logins, new devices, rules/forwards (especially email), and account activity.
4. **Contain:** uninstall suspicious extensions/apps, run malware scans, and update the system.
5. **Follow-up:** rotate related passwords (email first), revoke third-party access, and document what happened.

## One new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.
Habit: I will treat MFA and recovery security like a weekly check, not a one-time setup.
I'll use an authenticator/passkey for work account.
If I see anything unfamiliar, I'll revoke sessions/tokens immediately and report it following the team process.
