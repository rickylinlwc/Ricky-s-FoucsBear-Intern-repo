### 1) How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
- **Be concrete + structured:** use short paragraphs, clear headings, and numbered steps (“Step 1 / Step 2”) instead of dense blocks.
- **Default to neutral, non-judgmental language:** avoid “you should’ve / why didn’t you,” and replace with “let’s try / here’s one option.”
- **Offer choices, not pressure:** give 2–3 paths (“quick / standard / deep”) so the person can pick based on energy level.
- **Assume sensory + attention variability:** keep notifications/messages minimal; avoid rapid-fire follow-ups; summarize decisions at the end.

### 2) What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
- **Overwhelming UI:** too many options at once, long setup flows, or “everything everywhere” dashboards (background cognitive load).
- **Unpredictable navigation or sudden changes:** moving buttons/menus, inconsistent terminology, surprise pop-ups.
- **Too many nudges:** frequent notifications that feel like nagging; no easy way to throttle, batch, or silence them.
- **Not respecting autonomy:** forcing a single “right” routine instead of letting users customize intensity (especially for frustration tolerance).
- **Ambiguous instructions:** “be productive,” “focus now,” “plan your day” without a clear next step.

### 3) What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
**I will add a “low-cognitive-load” pass to anything I write or design:**
- rewrite to **plain language + ≤3 steps**,  
- include a **single recommended next action**,

Task

### A) First-person account (what I read + takeaway)
1) **Healthline staff first-person quotes about ADHD tools:** multiple ADHD-diagnosed team members describe what actually helps (timers, Notion, Finch, specialized task breakdown apps) and why—especially when tools reduce discouragement and make restarting easy after missed days. 

### B) One design/communication improvement for Focus Bear
**Add (or strengthen) a “Gentle Restart” flow** for when a user falls behind:
- Offer 3 buttons: **(1) 2-minute reset (2) Next best step (3) Skip today—plan tomorrow**  
- Make it explicitly **non-punitive** (no streak guilt), and keep choices minimal (reduce decision fatigue).

### C) Practice response: clear, patient, supportive message to a user struggling with executive functioning
> Hey — you’re not alone. When executive function is low, “starting” is genuinely hard, and it’s not a character flaw.  
>
> Let’s make this tiny and doable. Pick **one** option:
> 1) **Two-minute start:** Set a 2-minute timer and do the smallest possible action (open the document / put dishes in sink / write 1 sentence). Stop when the timer ends—you still win.  
> 2) **Next step only:** What’s the *very first* step? (Example: “open laptop,” not “finish assignment.”) Do that, then message me “done.”  
> 3) **Too hard today:** It’s okay to pause. Choose a **restart time** (e.g., after lunch), and we’ll set a single reminder and keep the plan short.
