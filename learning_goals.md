# My learning goals

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I'm hoping to learn the practical, day-to-day skills a cybersecurity analyst uses, including how to monitor alerts, investigate issues, and communicate findings clearly.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?
- Log analysis and alert triage (understanding what matters vs noise)
- Vulnerability assessment basics and how to prioritise fixes
- Incident response workflow (gather evidence, contain, document)
- Secure coding mindset (common mistakes and how to prevent them)

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I can contribute strong attention to detail, consistent follow-through, and clear written communication. I'm also comfortable learning fast, asking good questions. 

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you'd like to improve?
I feel less confident with real-world incident investigation and knowing "what to do next" under time pressure. I'd like to improve my judgement around prioritisation, escalation, and structuring an investigation step-by-step.


## What does success in this internship look like for you
Success looks like completing the onboarding smoothly, delivering real tasks that are useful to the team, and finishing the internship with stronger practical skills and confidence, so I can independently handle basic investigations, write up findings, and contribute to safer systems.
