## Reflection

### What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?
- Follow **least-privilege / need-to-know**: only access the data required for the task.
- **Minimise copying** sensitive info into notes, screenshots, or messages—summarise instead.
- Do a quick **PII + secrets scan** before sharing anything (logs, screenshots, links).
- Keep work on **approved tools/accounts only** (no personal drives or random apps).
- Lock my device when away, keep OS/apps updated, and avoid working in public spaces without privacy.

### How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?
**Store**
- Store sensitive data only in approved company systems/tickets.
- Avoid saving raw logs or user data locally unless required; prefer references/IDs.

**Share**
- Share only the minimum needed and redact identifiers (emails, phone numbers, IDs).
- Use private channels for anything sensitive; avoid posting in public/shared channels.
- Never paste secrets (tokens, keys, passwords) into chat.

**Dispose**
- Delete local copies when the task is finished.
- Don’t keep “just in case” files; keep only what is needed for the task.

### What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?
- **Posting screenshots/logs with PII or tokens** → redact/crop before sharing.
- **Committing secrets to GitHub** → use '.gitignore', check 'git status' and 'git diff' before every commit.
- **Using unapproved tools** (personal cloud, random AI tools) → only use approved tools; summarise/redact if asking for help.
- **Over-collecting data** for debugging → collect the minimum needed; delete after.
- **Not escalating quickly** after an accidental disclosure → report immediately so it can be contained.

## Task

### One habit/practice I will adopt to improve data security in my role
**“30-second privacy check” before I share anything:**
Before I send a message, upload a screenshot, or attach logs, I will quickly scan and remove/mask:
- emails / phone numbers
- tokens / API keys / session IDs
- user IDs and internal-only links

### One key learning / security measure I will implement
I will treat secure handling as part of the work itself: **minimise data, limit access, and redact by default**.  
If I’m unsure whether information is safe to share, I will ask in a private channel first rather than risking exposure.
