## Reflection

### 1) Equipment changes I can make to improve my setup
- Use a **laptop stand** (or stack of books) to raise the screen closer to eye level.
- Add an **external keyboard and mouse** so my wrists and shoulders stay neutral.

### 2) Behaviour changes I can implement
- Sit with my back supported and avoid leaning into the screen.
- Take short breaks regularly instead of one long break.
- Use the 20-20-20 rule to reduce eye strain during long screen time.

### 3) How I will remind myself to maintain posture and take breaks
- Schedule **movement reminders** (e.g., every 45–60 minutes) and a **posture check** reminder.
- Use Focus Bear’s reminders/routines to prompt:
  - a quick stretch
  - a water refill
  - a short walk

## Task

### 1) Workspace change(s) I made
- Raised my laptop screen using a stand/books so I’m not looking down.
- Positioned my chair so my feet are flat and my back is supported.

### 2) One equipment item that would improve comfort
- **External keyboard + mouse** (so I can keep wrists neutral while the screen stays higher).

### 3) Using reminders for a full workday — what I noticed
- I tried scheduled posture/movement reminders across a full workday.
- Improvements I noticed:
  - less neck stiffness
  - better focus after short movement breaks

### 4) One habit adjustment I will keep
- I will take a **2–3 minute movement break every ~60 minutes** and do a quick posture reset when I sit back down.
