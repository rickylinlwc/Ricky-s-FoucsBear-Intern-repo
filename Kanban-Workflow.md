## Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban helps because it shows everything in one place and makes priorities visible. When the “In progress” column is kept small, I’m encouraged to finish my current task before starting a new one. This avoids having many half-finished tasks and reduces overwhelm.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
- Break work into smaller tasks that can move to “Done” quickly.
- Keep WIP low (e.g., maximum 1–2 tasks in progress).
- Update status immediately when something changes (especially “Blocked”).
- Write clear task titles and acceptance criteria so “done” is unambiguous.
- Link tasks to evidence (commit/PR/file) so progress is easy to verify.

## Task

### Kanban board columns created (for my repo)
- Not started
- In progress
- Done

### One task moved through the Kanban process
Task moved: `Company Reflection (company_reflection.md)`
- Not started → In progress → Done

### One way I can improve task tracking in my role
I will create a GitHub Issue for each onboarding task, link it to the exact deliverable (file/commit/PR), and update the status on the board as soon as I start, get blocked, or finish. I will also keep “In progress” limited to 1–2 tasks to avoid overload.
