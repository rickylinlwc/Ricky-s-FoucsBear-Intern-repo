## Reflection

### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
My role is **Cyber Security Analyst Intern**. I contribute to the Agile process by working on small, trackable tasks that improve Focus Bear’s security and reliability. I help by:
- identifying security risks or gaps (e.g., insecure practices, risky configurations, weak processes)
- supporting vulnerability checks and basic security testing
- documenting findings clearly (notes, checklists, procedures) so the team can act on them
- moving tasks through the Kanban board so progress is visible and reviews happen smoothly

Because Agile focuses on delivering value in small increments, I try to deliver work in small pieces (documents, short reports, small PRs) that can be reviewed quickly and improved through feedback.

### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
- **Developers:** I may flag security risks, suggest safer approaches, or help review changes that affect security (e.g., authentication, data handling, permissions). Developers implement fixes, and I help validate or document them.
- **Product Manager / PM:** My security work supports product trust and user safety. If a security change affects user experience or priorities, I align with PM decisions and timelines.
- **QA / Testing:** If security issues relate to testing (e.g., login flows, privacy behaviour), I can help define test cases or edge cases. QA helps validate that changes don’t break functionality.
- **Customer support / stakeholders:** If incidents or user-reported issues appear, I may help triage patterns and advise on safe handling of logs/data.

## Task

### Short description of how my role fits into the Agile team
As a security intern, I support the team by turning security concerns into clear, actionable tasks and moving them through the workflow. I aim to provide fast, practical support—identify risks early, document clearly, and help the team ship improvements safely without slowing down delivery.

### One role I frequently collaborate with and how I will improve teamwork
I frequently collaborate with **developers**.

To improve teamwork, I will:
- provide clear, reproducible details (steps, screenshots/logs with sensitive data removed)
- suggest a low-risk fix or mitigation instead of only reporting a problem
- agree on the “definition of done” (what counts as fixed/secure)
- update the Kanban status early if I’m blocked so developers can respond faster
