# User Manual for Me

Name:         Ricky Lin
Role / Team:  Cyber analyst

---

## My Role 
I am working on:
- Cyber analyst
- Assist in monitoring system logs and alerts to detect potential security threats.
- Conduct basic vulnerability assessments and support penetration testing efforts.
- Collaborate with developers to ensure secure coding practices.
- Help document security procedures and update internal security policies.
- Support incident response activities by gathering information and analyzing root causes.
The days and times I work are:
- Monday in-person 11:00-3:30
- Wednesday and Friday from 12:00-17:30


## My working style (how I work best)
- Best time of day to focus:  
- I prefer tasks that are: (clear goals / small steps / deep work / pairing / etc.)  
- When I start a task, I usually: Read the task carefully, break it into small steps, and identify what "done" looks like. Then I check if I already have the tools/access I need. If something is unclear, I do a quick bit of research (docs, examples, past tickets).
- What helps me move fast: Clear goals and priorities (what matters most), a clear definition of done, and a good example/template to follow. Quick feedback also helps-so I can adjust early instead of going down the wrong path.

## Communication preferences
- Best channel for quick questions: Discord
- Best channel for tracking work (issues/PRs): Discord
- Best channel for contact in general: Discord / Emergency: 0474212689

## How to give me tasks (so I can succeed)
- Please include if impossible: (goal, priority, deadline, links, examples)  
- If the task is big, breakpoints/check-ins I like: I prefer splitting it into clear milestones, with a small deadline for each critical point (e.g., setup -> first draft -> testing -> final). At each milestone, I'll share what I've done so far in a standup or short async update, confirm I'm on the right track, and then continue to the next step.


## Communication Style
### I prefer messages to be...
- **Direct:** straight to the point is best for me.
- **Clear:** include what you need from me (a decision, an update, or an action).

- **Batched (when possible):** if you have multiple questions, putting them in one message helps me respond efficiently.

- **Context-first:** a short background + links/screenshots (redacted if sensitive) helps me understand faster.


## Collaboration & Teamwork
### I work best in a team when...
- The goal is clear: **what are we trying to achieve and why?**
- Expectations are clear: **priority + deadline + definition of done**
- People communicate respectfully and keep momentum (light humour is fine).

### My pet peeves
- Vague tasks with no success criteria.
- Too many meetings without decisions or next steps.
- Busywork updates instead of real progress.

### If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means...
- I'm processing/thinking through the problem, **or**
- I'm unsure about the context and don't want to interrupt (I'll follow up after).


## Feedback & Growth
### I like feedback to be...
- **Direct but kind**
- **Specific:** "change X to Y because Z"
- **Actionable:** what to do next is clear
- Preferably in writing (so I can apply it correctly)
